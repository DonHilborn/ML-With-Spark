Implementation of Machine Learning examples in Spark for the Coursera course - <https://www.coursera.org/course/ml>

##Octave Implementation

The implementation of the same examples in Octave is also available at <https://github.com/everpeace/ml-class-assignments>. This README file consists of how to run different examples.


##Available algorithms

####Linear Regression

####Logistic Regression

####K-Means Clustering

####Principal Component Analysis

##How to run?

Each algorithm has a specific package containing main methods which can be used to run the examples. Dataset for those examples can be found in the resources folder with the folder name as same as the algorithm name.
